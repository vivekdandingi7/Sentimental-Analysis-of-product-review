# Sentimental-Analysis-of-product-review
Tool - Excel


what exactly is sentiment analysis? Well, if you have a survey with multiple choice options, it's easy to analyze the data. However, when you have long answers with sentences or paragraphs, it becomes difficult to manually go through and determine the sentiment. This is where sentiment analysis comes in. There are two types - human supervised learning and machine learning. In the past, human supervised learning involved going through a portion of the data and categorizing positive and negative words. However, this method is limiting and requires constant re-categorization for different data sets.

This is where Excel's Azure Machine Learning comes in. It uses the MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon, a generic dictionary with over 5,000 negative words and 2,500 positive words. This method works well for short sentences, Tweets, and Facebook posts.
